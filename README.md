# m322

The project of the school module 322 is to implement an executable application with a GUI (Graphical User Interface). <br>
I made the whole project with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

## Views

I build a simple login system with a total of 4 views. A login view, a registration view, a reset password view and a view that you see when you are successfully logged in. <br>

<br> In the `Login View` you can enter your credentials to log in. There are also two links to switch to the Register view and Forgotpassword view. <br>

<br> If you don't have a account, you can register yourself in the `Register View`. You can type in your emailaddress, a username and a password and it will create a account for this user <br>

<br> If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it in the `Forgotpassword View`. The system will set you a new password and will inform you. <br>

<br> If you press "Log In" in the `Login View`, the system will check if the entered credentials are valid. If yes, it will switch to the `Afterlogin View` <br>
